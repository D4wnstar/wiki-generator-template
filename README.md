# Wiki Generator Website Template

This is the website template for the [Wiki Generator](https://github.com/D4wnstar/wiki-generator) plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). This is the code that will create and style your website. You can start using it by pressing the big **Deploy** button just below. Provided you are logged into [Vercel](https://vercel.com), it'll prompt you to copy the website by creating a new Project. Just follow the instructions and it'll be up and running in no time.
